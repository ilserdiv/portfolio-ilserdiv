    <h1>Web Development Quick Guide</h1>
    <p>
    Welcome to this tutorial, a fast-paced crash course on website developmentâ€”often called <em>web dev</em>. 
    This is my attempt to reframe the way I first learned it, with the hope that it can be absorbed in a single readâ€”though realistically, mastery always takes more practice. 
    While this may not be the most comprehensive resource due to its rapid pace and lighter focus on fine details, it serves well as a <strong>quick guide</strong> or even a reviewer for both beginners and experienced readers.
    </p>

    <p>
    Before we begin, a quick note: this page will not feature the most polished design. 
    Instead, it follows what I call my <em>default preferences</em>â€”a personal version of <code>Normalize.css</code>. 
    Think of it as my own CSS reset, ensuring a clean, consistent starting point for any new project. 
    I hope you donâ€™t mind the simplicity, and I may refine the UI/UX later on as the tutorial develops. 
    With that saidâ€”letâ€™s dive in!

        <h2>The Builder, The Designer, and the Event Organizer</h2>
        <p>
            Imagine your program as a concert. To make it happen, you need three essential things: 
            a <strong>place</strong> and the <strong>materials</strong> hold the event, a <strong>design</strong> to make it visually 
            appealing, and finally, the <strong>event itself</strong> to bring it all to life.
        </p>
        <p>
            First, letâ€™s think about the <em>place</em>. A concert venue needs a stage or platform, 
            a sound system with speakers and microphones, lighting rigs, seating or space for the 
            audience, backstage areas, and sometimes even big screens for those far away. 
            This foundation makes the concert possible, but if left plain, it feels empty and dull.
        </p>
        <p>
            Thatâ€™s where the <em>design</em> comes in. The same stage becomes exciting once you 
            add colorful lights, moving spotlights, lasers, smoke machines, confetti, and even 
            pyrotechnics. These donâ€™t change the structure itself, but they transform the atmosphere 
            into something engaging and memorable.
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally, the <em>event</em> itself happens: the performers come on stage, the band 
            plays music, singers interact with the crowd, and maybe thereâ€™s even dancing or 
            multimedia effects. This is where the audience experiences the actual purpose of 
            everything youâ€™ve prepared.
        </p>
        <p>
            In web development, these three roles correspond to:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>The Builder</strong> â†’ <code>HTML</code>, which provides the structure of the page.</li>
            <li><strong>The Designer</strong> â†’ <code>CSS</code>, which makes that structure look appealing.</li>
            <li><strong>The Event Organizer</strong> â†’ <code>JavaScript</code>, which brings interaction and functionality.</li>
        </ul>

            <h3>Another Way to See It</h3>
            <p>
                You can also think of web development as building an infrastructure. First, 
                youâ€™ll need a place and the basic materials. Then comes the designâ€”how the 
                building will look aesthetically. Finally, youâ€™ll need to make sure the 
                building actually works: the lights turn on and off, doors open and close, 
                appliances function, and if itâ€™s something larger like a mall, escalators, 
                elevators, and air-conditioning systems all need to be operational.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this comparison:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>HTML</strong> is like gathering the materials and laying out the structure. Itâ€™s usually the easiest part, since most of what you need is similar across projects.</li>
                <li><strong>CSS</strong> is the design stage. This is where things become visually appealing. Making a site look good is fun, but it requires deeper knowledge if you want to achieve professional results. Thatâ€™s why thereâ€™s a whole UI/UX field dedicated to itâ€”though as an aspiring web developer, itâ€™s wise to at least learn the basics.</li>
                <li><strong>JavaScript</strong> is the functionality layer. It makes things come aliveâ€”interactive, dynamic, and responsive. While itâ€™s often the most challenging, itâ€™s also the most important: without JavaScript, your project risks looking like an abandoned structure, a mere display rather than a working website.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Getting Started</h3>
            <p>
            Now you just need a place to write and view your code. There will be a lot 
            of options but I always like to go with the simplest tools and focus on 
            creation. So, here are my recommendations:
            </p>

            <h4>Visual Studio Code (IDE)</h4>
            <img src="./img/vs-code-logo.png" alt="Visual Studio Code Logo">
            <p>
                An IDE is where you write your code. Visual Studio Code is my 
                recommendation. Itâ€™s a complete package with everything built in, 
                saving you time compared to other IDEs...

            <h4>Google Chrome (Browser)</h4>

            <p>
                A browser is where you view your website in action. Chrome is the most 
                popular browser today, so using it ensures you see what most of your 
                users will see. While Firefox is more developer-friendly, Chrome gives 
                you the mainstream view...
